# Bike Sharing Assignment
## Problem Statement

### Business Understanding:
Working in the BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, aims to recover from revenue losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to identify factors influencing bike demand and build a predictive model. This will help optimize operations, meet customer needs, and regain market share in a competitive landscape.

### Objective:
The objective is to develop a reliable multiple linear regression model to predict daily bike demand and identify key factors driving it. By analyzing the relationships between demand and influencing variables such as weather, seasonality, and time, the model will provide actionable insights. These insights will enable BoomBikes to optimize operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and strategically plan for sustainable growth in a competitive post-pandemic market.

The Goal is to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict bike demand and identify key factors to help BoomBikes optimize operations and drive growth.
